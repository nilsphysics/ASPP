## Project

### Introduction

My research is focused on ultra-high-energy neutrino detection. The signals of these elementary particles result in a voltage amplitude trace for multiple detectors. From these voltages, I'm reconstructing the energy, direction, and flavor of the original neutrino using deep neural networks. A python script exists that can train a convolutional neural network to reconstruct the energy of the neutrinos using PyTorch. However, when trying to optimize these networks it is important to scan over many different hyperparameters and efficiently train different models.   

### Project Specifications

In my project, I want to focus on refactoring the existing script to be more flexible towards new detector designs with more input channels and optimize the way the trained models are saved and can be accessed for future use. In case I have enough time I also want to create a similar process for direction and flavor reconstruction since these require similar but slightly different architectures. To keep track of the different specifications and make this process easy to use for other people I would like to improve the comments and documentation for the training process.
