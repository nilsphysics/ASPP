## Project

### Introduction

My research is focused on ultra high-energy neutrino detection. The signals of these elemetrary particles results in a voltage amplitude trace for multiple detectors. From these voltages I'm reconstructing the energy, direction an flavor of the original neutrino using deep neural networks.
